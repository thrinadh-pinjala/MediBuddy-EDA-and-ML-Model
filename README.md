In the assignment below, there are two datasets, one having the age and BMI(Body
Mass Index) that is received from a pre health checkup before the policy cover; and the
other dataset includes some personal details such as the no. of children, whether the
person smokes or not, the location where the person is from etc.
Share your analysis for the below:
1. Does the gender of the person matter for the company as a constraint for
extending policies?
2. What is the average amount of money the company spent over each policy
cover?
3. Could you advice if the company needs to offer separate policies based upon the
geographic location of the person?
4. Does the no. of dependents make a difference in the amount claimed?
5. Does a study of persons BMI get the company any idea for the insurance claim
that it would extend?
6. Is it needed for the company to understand whether the person covered is a
smoker or a non-smoker?
7. Does age have any barrier on the insurance claimed?
8. Can the company extend certain discounts after checking the health status
(BMI) in this case?


In addition to the above analysis, build a machine learning model to predict the
amount spent to the utmost accuracy. Validate and hyper parametrically tune the
model to get the best results.
